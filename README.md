# Python Lung Cancer Detection

## Description
[Lung Cancer Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/lung-cancer-detection) is designed for lung cancer prediction using Machine Learning techniques. It provides data to develop an early prediction system that allows evaluating lung cancer risk in an economical and accessible way.

## Objective
The main objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of predictive models that can:
* Help in early detection of lung cancer
* Provide preliminary risk assessments
* Assist in initial medical decision-making

## Importance
Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. This prediction system offers:
* Low-cost risk assessment
* Accessibility for the general population
* Support in preventive medical decision-making

## Data Origin
The data was collected through an online lung cancer prediction system, incorporating various risk factors and symptoms associated with this disease.

## Application
This dataset can be used for:
* Development of Machine Learning models
* Research in early cancer detection
* Creation of medical decision support systems
* Epidemiological studies

## Note
Results derived from this dataset should be considered as preliminary screening tools and do not replace professional medical diagnosis.
